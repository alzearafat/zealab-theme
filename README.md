ABOUT
---------------

**ZEALAB THEME V1.2 - Clean, Minimalist, Responsive WordPress Theme**

I made this WordPress theme for my own personal blog (http://zealab.com), with clean, simplicity and readability in mind. Because I want to focus on content rather than design, So don't expect too much... But it gets the job done ;-)

5. Done!


HOW TO USE ADMIN PANEL

In this Example, I'll show you how to change Font-Awesome's Icons in the homepage using Admin Panel :

1. Go to [font-awesome's official website](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)
2. Pick your icon, and copy its 'i' class **(JUST ITS i CLASS!)**. See screenshot below :
