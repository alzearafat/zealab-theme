ABOUT
---------------

**Zealab Theme - Clean, Minimalist, Responsive WordPress Theme**

I made this WordPress theme for my own personal blog (http://zealab.com), with clean, simplicity and readability in mind. Because I want to focus on content rather than design, So don't expect too much... But it gets the job done ;-)


HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
1. Download theme : https://github.com/alzearafat/zealab-theme/archive/master.zip
2. Upload to your /wordpress-installation-folder/wp-content/themes
3. Activate from admin's dashboard >> Apreance >> Themes
4. Install required plugins (Check your dashboard after activation)
5. Done!


TO-DO
---------------

1. Add portfolio page
2. Add admin options
3. Make small wiki
4. ...?


*NOTE
---------------
I know this theme is far from perfect, it doesn't intended to. Some parts of this theme is still hard-coded (services & about me). Yes, I'm planning to create native admin options, but I can't promises soon... Due to my busy schedule at office. But if you are impatient, you can use this awesome plugin : [Tonjoo Theme Option Maker (TTOM)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tonjoo-theme-option-maker/)
